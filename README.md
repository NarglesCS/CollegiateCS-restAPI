REST API for my website written in GO

This a work in progress API for my website collegiatecs.com

Currently, the API that is on the server is written in node.js+express. I am trying to convert it to convert it to GO because I feel like working with GO will be easier to implement the features that I want.

---Game - package for game related objects   
---Team - package for team related objects  
---University - package for University related objects (Not yet built)
